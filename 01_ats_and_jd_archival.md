# Pipeline Step 1: ATS Check & Job Description Archival

> **READ-ONLY SKILL FILES — HARD GUARDRAIL:** The `renderers/` directory, all top-level pipeline scripts (`zvec_hybrid_search.py`, `okf_portfolio_search.py`, `okf_lint.py`, `embedding_server.py`, etc.), `okf/base_files/`, `okf/portfolio/`, and all pipeline step docs are **PERMANENTLY READ-ONLY** during this step. The model MUST NOT edit, patch, or modify any of these files. **The ONLY files the model writes in this step are** `ATS_Report.yaml`, `Job_Description.yaml`, `Job_Description.pdf`, and `project_info.md` (inside the current application folder). This rule has no exceptions.

> **AGENT EXECUTION RULES:** Follow the Tool-Call Execution Protocol in `SKILL.md` §"Agent Execution & Anti-Spinning Rules". Do not emit multi-paragraph planning prose or un-called YAML drafts before tool calls. Keep commentary to 1 sentence per action. Batch independent tool calls.

> **YAML SAFETY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
>
> JD text and resume content frequently contain characters that break YAML parsing (`: ` followed by space, leading `-`, `#`, unbalanced quotes, `>`/`|` at start of value). To prevent parse failures:
>
> 1. **Quote all string values** that could contain `:`, `-`, `#`, `>`, `|`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, or quotes. Use double quotes: `company: "SAP SE"`.
> 2. **Use block scalars (`|`)** for multi-line content (JD overview paragraphs, bullet text longer than one line):
>    ```yaml
>    content: |
>      The data engineer will build and maintain pipelines...
>    ```
> 3. **Never paste raw JD text directly into a YAML value without quoting or block-scaling it.** JDs almost always contain colons (e.g., "Requirements:") that will break parsing.
> 4. **After writing each YAML file**, validate it by running `/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('FILENAME'))"` before proceeding to compilation. If it fails, fix the quoting and re-validate.

## Objective
Analyze the target job description (JD) against the candidate's base resume and project portfolio to detect gaps, classify the role archetype, calculate an ATS score, and structure the clean JD for archival.

## Inputs
- **Job Description (JD):** Paste target JD text at the bottom. The JD text may arrive from either (a) the user pasting it directly, or (b) Step 0 (JD Fetch) scraping it from a URL — in case (b), Step 0 also passes forward a `source_url` (string, optional) and the detected ATS vendor, which Step 1 should record in `Job_Description.yaml` (see §"Job_Description.yaml Schema") and reuse in §"0c. ATS Vendor Inference" without re-inferring. Step 1's behavior is otherwise identical for both input paths.
- **Base Resume & Portfolio:** Loaded from the local `okf/` folder inside the skill directory. Archetype-specific base resumes are selected based on the JD's role archetype (e.g. `okf/base_files/english/resume_data_engineer.md`, `okf/base_files/english/resume_data_analyst.md`, `okf/base_files/english/resume_analytics_engineer.md`, `okf/base_files/english/resume_ai_data_engineer.md`). Falls back to `okf/base_files/english/resume.md` for unmatched archetypes. German equivalents use `_de` suffix (e.g. `resume_data_engineer_de.md`).

## Execution Rules

### 0a. Name the Session
Per SKILL.md §"Name the Session" — extract Company Name and Job Role from the JD and rename this session to `[Company Name] — [Job Role]`.

### 0b. Pre-Scoring: Verify Dependencies & Load Base Files
Before any scoring or analysis, perform the following verification and loading steps:
1. **Python Environment (no action needed):** All pipeline dependencies are pre-installed in the project-local virtual environment at `/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/`. **All `python` commands in this pipeline MUST use the absolute path `/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python`** verbatim, regardless of the current working directory. Do NOT run `pip install` — the venv is already provisioned and gitignored. The previous 24hr dependency-check cache (`okf/.dep_check.json`) has been removed; the venv is the single source of truth for dependencies.
2. **Frontmatter Lint:** Run the OKF linter to verify portfolio metadata is clean before scoring:
   ```bash
   /home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python "/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/okf_lint.py"
   ```
   If the linter fails, fix the offending frontmatter before proceeding.
3. **Pre-Warm Embedding Server (eliminate ~70s cold start):** Before the hybrid search runs, pre-warm the embedding daemon so the SentenceTransformer model is already in memory when `zvec_hybrid_search.py` needs it. This calls `_ensure_daemon()` from `zvec_hybrid_search.py` — the same function the hybrid search uses internally — which pings an existing daemon, starts one in the background if none is running, and waits up to 30s for it to become responsive. Run this immediately after the dependency check, in parallel with the frontmatter lint:
   ```bash
   /home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, r'/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv'); from zvec_hybrid_search import _ensure_daemon; print('Embedding daemon ready' if _ensure_daemon() else 'Daemon unavailable — will fall back to direct model load')"
   ```
   If this prints "Daemon unavailable", the pipeline still works — `zvec_hybrid_search.py` falls back to direct model loading (~21s per invocation). Pre-warming just eliminates that delay for the common case.
4. **Load base resume:** Load the candidate's base resume from the detected language folder. The pipeline uses **archetype-specific base resumes** to maximize pre-rewrite ATS scores:
   - First, detect the JD's primary role archetype from the job title and description. The supported archetypes are:
     - `Data Engineer` → `resume_data_engineer.md`
     - `Data Analyst` → `resume_data_analyst.md`
     - `Analytics Engineer` → `resume_analytics_engineer.md`
     - `AI Data Engineer` → `resume_ai_data_engineer.md`
   - Load the matching archetype base resume from `okf/base_files/english/` (or `okf/base_files/german/` for German JDs — append `_de` to the filename, e.g. `resume_data_engineer_de.md`).
   - If the archetype doesn't match any of the 4 specific bases, fall back to the generic `resume.md` (or `resume_de.md` for German).
   *(Note: You do not need to load the global project_info.md file in Step 1, because the OKF search command in Step 1 will dynamically generate a tailored project_info.md file inside the application folder).*

Do not proceed to scoring without first running the dependency installation, the linter, and loading the base resume file. All gap analysis and keyword comparisons must reference the loaded resume content.

### 0c. ATS Vendor Inference & Application Source
Before scoring, gather monoculture-counter metadata:

1. **ATS Vendor Inference:** Scan the JD text and any target application URL for common ATS system footprints:
   - `myworkdayjobs.com` → `Workday`
   - `personio.de` / `personio.com` → `Personio`
   - `successfactors.eu` / `successfactors.com` → `SAP SuccessFactors`
   - `greenhouse.io` → `Greenhouse`
   - `lever.co` → `Lever`
   - `taleo.net` → `Taleo`
   - If none found, default to `Unknown`.
2. **Application Source Selection:** Prompt the user for the application source. Valid values: `Cold Apply`, `Referral`, `LinkedIn Connection`, `Direct`.
   - If the source is `Cold Apply` and the vendor is known (not `Unknown`), output a warning advising the user to check their network for weak ties before submitting.
   - If the source is `Referral` or `LinkedIn Connection`, prompt for the optional `weak_tie_contact` (name or role of the contact).

> **Note:** The diversity audit (`okf_diversity_audit.py`) is no longer run automatically per application. It is a standalone tool for weekly review — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"Weekly Review: Diversity Audit". For per-application outcome and channel tracking, use `track_outcomes.py report` (see README).

### 1. Requirements & Archetype Detection
- Scan candidate-facing profile requirements.
- Classify the JD into exactly one primary role archetype (e.g., Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, Data Analyst, AI Engineer, AI/LLMOps, Agentic/Automation, ML Engineering, Backend/Platform Engineering).
- Save selection and a one-sentence rationale under `role_archetype` in the YAML output.
- **Secondary archetype:** If the JD clearly spans two domains (e.g., requires both ML engineering and data platform work), assign a `secondary` archetype with its own one-sentence rationale. If the JD is focused on a single domain, omit the `secondary` field entirely.

### 2. German-Market ATS Scoring Matrix
- Grade the current resume against a German-market calibrated matrix (0-100 total) using **4 equally-weighted categories** (25 points each):
  - `keywords_and_terminology` (max 25)
  - `experience_relevance` (max 25)
  - `technical_skills` (max 25)
  - `soft_skills_and_language` (max 25)
- **Formatting is NOT scored.** Instead, emit a separate non-scored `formatting_quality` verdict (see below) that classifies the resume's formatting/parsability as one of `Excellent`, `Good`, `Average`, or `Bad`. If the verdict is `Average` or `Bad`, populate `suggestions` with concrete fixes. This keeps formatting feedback visible without diluting the 100-point score.
- Save category details and total score in `ats_score_matrix`, and the formatting verdict in `formatting_quality`, in the YAML output.
- **Score Flag (informational only, not a gate):** This 0-100 score is a self-assessment by the same model performing the rewrite, run against no external ATS system — it has no established correlation with real recruiter/interview outcomes and MUST NOT block or delay submission. If `total_score < 85`, set `score_gate_verdict: REVIEW` and populate `remedy_suggestions` as a structured list (see schema) so the user can see the specific weak points, but proceed to Step 2 regardless. If `>= 85`, set `score_gate_verdict: PROCEED`. Never halt the pipeline on this score alone.

### 3. Skill Gap Analysis (P2)
After scoring and project selection, extract a `skill_gaps` list:
- Extract a `required_skills` list from the JD — technologies, tools, and methodologies explicitly mentioned as required or strongly preferred.
- Collect `resume_skills` from the base resume's technical skills section and `project_skills` from the matched projects in `project_info.md` (technologies + keywords).
- Compute `skill_gaps = required_skills - (resume_skills ∪ project_skills)`.
- Store the result as a flat list of strings under `skill_gaps` in `ATS_Report.yaml`.
- The agent uses this list during Step 2 to make targeted additions where justified (add to skills section, weave into project descriptions, or note as genuine gaps).

### 4. Contextual Placement Weighting (P4)
After the 4-category ATS score is computed, perform a contextual placement check on critical JD keywords:
- Extract the top critical keywords from the JD (the same keywords used in the `keywords_and_terminology` scoring category).
- For each keyword, check which sections of the base resume contain it: `skills`, `projects`, or `experience`.
- Apply a placement multiplier per keyword:
  - Found in skills section only: **1.0x**
  - Found in project summary only: **1.2x**
  - Found in experience bullet only: **1.3x**
  - Found in multiple sections: **1.5x**
  - Not found: omit from the list (already captured in `skill_gaps` or `keyword_inventory`)
- Store results under `placement_breakdown` in `ATS_Report.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  placement_breakdown:
    keywords:
      - keyword: "Kafka"
        sections_found: ["skills", "projects", "experience"]
        multiplier: 1.5
  ```
- This sub-report is informational — it does not change the 4-category score. It highlights where evidence-based keyword usage is strong (multiple sections) and where it is weak (skills section only).

### 5. Pre-Rewrite Semantic Similarity (P1)
After writing `ATS_Report.yaml` and `Job_Description.yaml`, compute the pre-rewrite cosine similarity between the base resume and the JD:
```bash
cd "/home/sagar/Applications/[Company Name] — [Job Role]/"
/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python "/home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/zvec_hybrid_search.py" --similarity "[base_resume_path]" "Job_Description.yaml"
```
The base resume path is the archetype-specific file loaded in Step 0b (e.g., `okf/base_files/english/resume_data_engineer.md`). Write the returned float value to `resume_jd_semantic_similarity.pre_rewrite_similarity` in `ATS_Report.yaml`. (The `--similarity` flag uses the same model as the hybrid search, avoiding a second model load.)

### 6. Improvement Blueprint Generation
Populate each field of `improvement_blueprint` as follows:
- **`bullet_point_density_audit`:** For each bullet in the base resume's experience and projects sections, check if it contains a quantified metric (number, percentage, or time unit). List any bullets that are metric-free as items requiring quantification.
- **`project_swap_directive`:** Compare each project in the portfolio against the JD archetype. List projects that are misaligned under `remove_projects`. List archetype-aligned projects from `project_info.md` that are not currently in the base resume under `add_projects`, each with a one-sentence `justification`. Confirm exactly 3 (or 4 if score improves) are selected.
- **`keyword_inventory`:** Extract only JD keywords that are **absent from the base resume** (gap-only approach). Do not list keywords already present. Categorize absences into `hard_skills`, `methodologies`, and `domain_terms`.
- **`technical_skills_tuning`:** List tools/technologies to add (present in JD, absent from resume skills section) and to remove (present in resume skills section but irrelevant or distracting for this role).
- **`quantified_outcomes`:** For each metric-free bullet identified in the density audit, suggest a concrete revised version that adds a plausible quantified outcome.

### 7. Job Description Archival & Location Extraction
- Strip web tracking, cookies, duplicate fields, and metadata from the raw JD.
- Extract the job location from the raw JD (e.g., Munich, Berlin, Remote, etc.). Save it under a top-level `location` field in `Job_Description.yaml`.
- Structure into clean YAML sections (overview, requirements, responsibilities, stack) for permanent reference.

### 8. Candidate Location Selection
- The candidate has 4 candidate cities: **Kiel** (home), **Frankfurt**, **Berlin**, and **Köln**.
- **Static lookup + cache first:** Check the job location against the static geocode table and the persistent location cache in `config.py`. Run this Python one-liner to resolve:
  ```bash
  /home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python -c "from config import nearest_candidate_city; print(nearest_candidate_city('[job_location]') or 'NOT_FOUND')"
  ```
  This checks the static `JOB_LOCATION_TO_CANDIDATE_CITY` table first, then falls back to `okf/.location_cache.json` (which stores locations previously resolved via web search). If either hits, no web search is needed.
- **Web search fallback:** If the lookup returns `NOT_FOUND`, use **web search** to determine which of the 4 cities is geographically nearest to the job location. Then cache the result so future applications with the same location skip the web search:
  ```bash
  /home/sagar/Skills/okf-cv/.venv/bin/python -c "from config import cache_location_result; cache_location_result('[job_location]', '[resolved_city, Germany]')"
  ```
- For remote, country-wide, or unspecified locations, default to **Kiel, Germany**.
- Save the result (e.g. `Frankfurt, Germany`) under `closest_candidate_location` in the root of `ATS_Report.yaml`.

## Output Target & Directory Structure
Create folder `/home/sagar/Applications/[Company Name] — [Job Role]/` and save three files:
- `ATS_Report.yaml`
- `Job_Description.yaml`
- `project_info.md` (tailored project portfolio generated via OKF search)

**Naming Convention:** Per SKILL.md — folder MUST be `/home/sagar/Applications/[Company Name] — [Job Role]/`. No arbitrary names or timestamps. Always use this absolute path — never create application folders relative to the agent's current working directory.
